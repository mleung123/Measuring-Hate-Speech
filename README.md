Dataset sourced from http://hatespeech.berkeley.edu. Predictors and other information about the data can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucberkeley-dlab/measuring-hate-speech/blob/main/README.md

A variety of machine learning models to predict the presence and intensity of hate speech in social media comments. Techniques used include KNeighbors, Decision Trees, XGBoosting, Stacking Ensembles, and RNNs.
Work in progress. The best model currently has a RMSE of 1.148 on the training set and 1.349 on the test set. For more information, see the report.
